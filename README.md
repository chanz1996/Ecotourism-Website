# Ecotourism-Website
Website for Ecotourism Travels 

My First Web Technology project done as part of Web Technology - I course in B.Tech study.The ecotourism travels website was built to showcase the  impact of ecotourism on environment conservation and aid its promotion.It aggregates  and compiles key ecotourism travels in India and presents a comprehensive overview for three different modes - through rail, indian ghats and the lagoons of Kerala.

The website utilises various elements of HTML,CSS and Javascript with each web page making use of new elements like image sliders,video embedding and web forms.
