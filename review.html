Not bad,however I had to regularly make contact with them as I was not getting feedback and confirmation 
from them regarding confirmation of my hotels .. it all was great they honored the package as promised..</p>

Their support is very good including Car, driver, Hotel and other support.The hotel bookings were as promised and 
really impressive,where as they must improve their logistics above par. </p>

It was excellent but they have given me bus driver was crazy and there is something hiding in when you give the prices. 
We are happy with hotels but not the transport system.</p>

We had the worst experience with the travel agent. All false information and false promises. Never will I chose this 
again nor will I recommend this to anyone.</p>

I used the travel agent in the hotel and they did fine. Noticed that their rates were lower than all the prices quoted to me online, 
and that's from a five-star hotel too!</p>
